    ### influxdb related specs
    ## influxdb URL to connect to execute continuous queries, to create summary buckets
    ##   can be an IP address, FQDN or localhost if executing the script on a host where influxdb is running. 
    InfluxdbURL: "http://localhost:8086"
    ## token - get this from influxdb configuration, this is used to connect to Influxdb to exerice client APIs.
    # InfluxdbToken: hpM15Uxu3i490KO-sXNarv1Eluar3al-lFkbmRS4Jx3Q6iPSBJTm9ak-V3AjrSy8S2M80YdKY0_gu59yUDOzdQ==
    InfluxdbToken: <yourToken>
    ## organization - get this from influxdb configuration
    ##  this version supports operations within a single org. 
    ##  if there is enough interest, can support operations acorss multiple org in future version.
    InfluxdbOrg: havembha
    ## if True, summary buckets will be created and tasks will be added to summarize the data based on 'SummaryGroups' spec
    ##    False, buckets will not be operated on. Grafana panels will be created based on SummaryGroups and SummaryValueType definitions
    ##           it is assumed that the user created the buckets with expected naming conventions.
    InfluxdbManageSummaryBuckets: True
    ## include bucket names below while creating summary buckets
    ## all - all buckets will be included, default
    ## regex expression - include the bucket name that matches to the regex
    ## IncludeBuckets: all
    IncludeBuckets: test
    ## exclude bucket names below while creating summary buckets
    ## None - nothing will be excluded, default
    ## regex expression - exclude the bucket name that matches to the regex
    ## ExcludeBuckets: None
    ExcludeBuckets: test2

    ### grafana dashboard related specs
    ## grafana URL to connect to exercise HTTP API. This can be HTTP or HTTPS.
    ##  can be an IP address, FQDN or localhost if executing the script on a host where influxdb is running. 
    GrafanaAPIURL: "https://localhost:6443/api/"
    ### Below two specs (SummaryGroups and SummaryValueTypes) will be combined to form influxdb bucket name for summary data.
    ##  SummaryGroups - supported values: ['Hourly', 'Daily', 'Weekly'] 
    ##  SummaryValueTypes - supported values: [ 'Min', 'Max', 'Mean'] 
    ## These needs to match the influxdb bucket names for summary bucket types.
    ##  Below spec results in bucket names: 
    ##   *HourlyMin, *HourlyMax, *HourlyMean
    ##   *DailyMin,  *DailyMax,  *DailyMean
    SummaryGroups: ['Hourly', 'Daily']
    SummaryValueTypes: [ 'Min', 'Max', 'Mean']
    ### default '[time']['from'] for the summary dashboard based on summary group
    ## format: [ key1: value1, key2: value2, key3: value3,...]
    ## key like Daily, Hourly, Weekly needs to match the group word used in SummaryGroups
    ## value string specifies the from time spec to be used in dashboard range selection. 
    SummaryDashboardTimeFrom: {"Hourly": "now-3d", "Daily": "now-30d", "Weekly": "now-180d"}
    ### influxdb bucket retention duration in days for SummaryGroups
    ## 90 days for 'Hourly', one year for 'Daily' and 3 years for 'Weekly' summary buckets
    InfluxdbBucketRetentionRules: {"Hourly": 90, "Daily": 365, "Weekly": 1095}
    ## debugLevel 0 - no debug, 1 to 4, 4 being max details
    DebugLevel: 1
    ### limit the dashboard creation or update to below number
    ##   can use this during the initial stage to experiment with automatic summarization 
    ## if not defined or set to 0, no limit will be applied.
    MaxSummaryDashboards: 0 
    ### regular expression definition of dashboard title to include in 
    ###   creating or update of summary dashboards
    ###   can use this to limit the summary dashboard creation or update of the dashboards with 
    ###     desired name pattern 
    ### default - all - to include all dashboards 
    IncludeDashboards: all 
    # IncludeDashboards: home network 
    # IncludeDashboards: dashboard with no library panel|dashboard with single library panel
    # IncludeDashboards: dashboard with single library panel
    ###
    ### regular expression definition of dashboard title to exclude from 
    ###   creating or update of summary dashboards
    ###   can use this to skip the summary dashboard creation or update of the dashboards with 
    ###     desired name pattern 
    ### default - none, for no exclusion 
    ###  
    ExcludeDashboards: none
